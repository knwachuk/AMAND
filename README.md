# Autonomous Mapping and Navigating Drone

# AMAND Overview
The AMAND is an autonomous drone that is designed to traverse it's environment without human interaction or aid. This autonomouse drone vehicle  will be comprised of different functions. These functions will be the SBC, LidarSensing, and _______ ( ongoing). Each of these functions need each other for the autnomous drone vehicle to work properly. In this README.md file, we will be discussing the steps taken in order for this project to be intergratble for the upcoming students of the Data Engineering and Predictive Analytics laboratory.

# SBC 
The SBC is a C code based function, where we will show steps for below explaining the code, and the steps that it will take in order for it interact with the other functions of the drone vehicle. The following steps can be changed to meet the requirements of the environment that the vehicle will be present in. Lets begin:
